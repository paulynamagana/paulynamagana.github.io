excerpt: 'Recent advancements in protein structure determination and especially in protein structure prediction techniques have led to the availability of vast amounts of macromolecular structures. However, the accessibility and integration of these structures into scientific workflows are hindered by the lack of standardization among publicly available data resources. To address this issue, we introduced the 3D-Beacons Network, a unified platform that aims to establish a standardized framework for accessing and displaying protein structure data. In this article, we highlight the importance of standardized approaches for accessing protein structure data and showcase the capabilities of 3D-Beacons. We describe four protocols for finding and accessing macromolecular structures from various specialist data resources via 3D-Beacons. First, we describe three scenarios for programmatically accessing and retrieving data using the 3D-Beacons API. Next, we show how to perform sequence-based searches to find structures from model providers. Then, we demonstrate how to search for structures and fetch them directly into a workflow using JalView. Finally, we outline the process of facilitating access to data from providers interested in contributing their structures to the 3D-Beacons Network.'
