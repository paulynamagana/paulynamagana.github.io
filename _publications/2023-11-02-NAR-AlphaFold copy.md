title: "AlphaFold Protein Structure Database in 2024: providing structure coverage for over 214 million protein sequences"
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-NAR_AlphaFold
excerpt: 'The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB) is a massive digital library of predicted protein structures, with over 214 million entries, marking a 500-times expansion in size since its initial release in 2021. The structures are predicted using Google DeepMind''s AlphaFold 2 artificial intelligence (AI) system. Our new report highlights the latest updates we have made to this database. We have added more data on specific organisms and proteins related to global health and expanded to cover almost the complete UniProt database, a primary data resource of protein sequences. We also made it easier for our users to access the data by directly downloading files or using advanced cloud-based tools. Finally, we have also improved how users view and search through these protein structures, making the user experience smoother and more informative. In short, AlphaFold DB has been growing rapidly and has become more user-friendly and robust to support the broader scientific community.'
