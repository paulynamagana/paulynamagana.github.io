I'm Paulyna, a bioinformatician based near Cambridge, currently diving deep into the world of protein structures with the AlphaFold Database team at EMBL-EBI. My core passion lies at the intersection of computational biology and AI â€“ I truly believe we can accelerate drug discovery by cleverly harnessing these tools.

My journey began with a BSc in Genomic Biotechnology in Mexico, followed by an MSc and eventually a PhD from the University of Nottingham. My doctoral research, focusing on Solute Carrier Transporters using everything from computational analysis to CRISPR, really cemented my love for tackling complex biological questions with data.
