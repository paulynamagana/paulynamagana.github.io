In January 2025, I had the rewarding experience of coordinating the AlphaFold Education Summit (AFES), a key collaboration with Google DeepMind. Our global mission was to empower researchers and educators worldwide. At its core, AFES implemented a 'train-the-trainer' model, featuring dedicated workshops on both AlphaFold 2 and the capabilities of AlphaFold 3. This approach was designed to scale expertise globally, enabling participants to integrate these tools into research and teaching, with a crucial focus on enhancing accessibility for those in under-resourced regions and tackling significant scientific challenges.
