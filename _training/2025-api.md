title: "From sequences to structures: Protein characterisation using EMBL-EBI APIs"
collection: training
type: "Virtual course"
permalink: /training/2025-api
venue: "EMBL-EBI training site"
date: 2025-06-05
location: "Hinxton, UK"
description: "This one-day, hands-on virtual workshop will guide participants through a structured, programmatic workflow using EMBL-EBI resources. Participants will learn how to retrieve protein sequences, identify homologs, annotate functional domains, and explore structural information using REST APIs. The course emphasises programmatic access (APIs) to integrate sequence, functional, and structural data into a unified analysis pipeline. Through a step-by-step Python workflow, participants will apply different EMBL-EBI tools to analyse an example protein, gaining practical experience in automating large-scale protein data analysis.."

Proteins are fundamental to biological processes, and understanding their sequence, structure, and function is crucial for various applications in research. This one-day, hands-on virtual workshop guided participants through a structured, programmatic workflow using EMBL-EBI resources.

For this course I created Google Colab notebooks to demonstrate the use of AFDB API:

1. AlphaFold DB API Introduction
This notebook introduces how to use a programming interface (API) to access protein structure predictions from the AlphaFold Database. It includes code examples for retrieving and exploring these predictions programmatically.


2. AFDB Data Visualisation
This notebook focuses on visualising the protein structure data available in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB). It demonstrates how to use Python tools to render plDDT, PAE and AlphaMissense plots.

3. AFDB_BigQuery.ipynb
This notebook provides a guide to accessing and querying AlphaFold Database information using Google BigQuery. Key topics include:
