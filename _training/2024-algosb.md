The Algorithms in Structural Bioinformatics (AlgoSB) school provided an intensive learning environment, and I was honoured to contribute as an instructor for the 2024 edition in Cargèse. On Tuesday, November 19th, my co-lecturer Maxim Tsenkov and I delivered a session titled "AlphaFold: A Case Study in Deep Learning for Protein Structure Prediction." We explored its foundational aspects, its impact, limitations, and future potential. The afternoon was dedicated to practical application, where I led the hands-on session, focusing on tangible skills: sampling predictions, identifying remote homologous proteins, and effectively evaluating and enriching structures sourced from the AlphaFold Database.
