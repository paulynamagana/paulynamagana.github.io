description: "EMBL-EBI virtual workshop on structural bioinformatics. Learn to analyze 3D macromolecular structures, predict molecular function, and explore interactions using experimental and AI-predicted models."

---

This EMBL-EBI course delves into the methods and tools vital for structural bioinformatics. Participants explore how to leverage 3D structural data – whether experimentally determined or predicted by AI – to gain insights into how macromolecules function. It covers key bioinformatics resources, techniques for analysis and interpretation, methods for predicting function, and approaches to exploring molecular interactions.
