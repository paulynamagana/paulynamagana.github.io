AlphaFold database (AlphaFold DB) provides open access to over 200 million protein structure predictions to accelerate scientific research. This webinar aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to AlphaFold DB. Participants will gain a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts, principles, and functionalities of the database. They will learn how to access and evaluate predicted protein structures, explore the underlying technologies and algorithms used in AlphaFold, and identify the potential applications of AlphaFold DB in their research
