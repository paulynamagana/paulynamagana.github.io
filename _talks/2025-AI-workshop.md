I was thrilled to contribute to the Cambridge-Google Workshop: Learning from Experts in Computational Biology and AI last April. As part of a dynamic program, I joined forces with Hariprasad Radhakrishnan (Google Cloud) and Oleg Kovalevskiy (Google DeepMind) to lead a hands-on session. My presentation delved into the AlphaFold database, illustrating its immense value for researchers with concrete case studies and applications. We were delighted by the enthusiastic participation and the thoughtful questions from the 120+ delegates, making it a truly interactive and successful part of a fantastic day organised by the Milner Institute and Google.
